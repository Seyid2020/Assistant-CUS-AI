## Global Context & Challenges

### Demographic Surge in Africa

Over the next two decades, Africa (particularly sub-Saharan Africa) will experience a very strong demographic surge:
- More than **860 million new city dwellers** expected
- Population and surface area of cities will **double in one generation**
- This represents a major challenge, both spatially and socially
- While urbanization is a global trend, the challenges will be greatest on the African continent

### Digital Revolution

A new urban revolution - the digital revolution - is profoundly transforming the way we manage and design cities:

**Opportunities:**
- New types of data (perception, real-time, opinions, ideas)
- New quantity of data (big urban data)
- Over 90% of the world's data has been produced in the last 2 years

**Challenges:**
- When it comes to urban issues, vast quantities of data are produced, but nobody - or almost nobody - knows how to process it or understand its potential
- Tools are sorely lacking
- The most innovative projects in urban data show a fascination for methods and technology, while citizens tend to drift further away: ever more connected, but ever more distant
- The social question is a priority - we need to put technology back at the service of city-dwellers, not the other way round

### Professional Gap

Currently, these digital issues for cities are taking place in a context where:
- Professionals are poorly structured, poorly trained, and few in number
- Unable to meet the growing challenges posed by digital urbanization
- The city is cruelly lacking in reflection, professionals, tools, and innovation
- Traditional urban management will soon be outdated and a need for reinvention is necessary
- New professions are appearing without cities being able to take them into account in their practice

## Objectives

### Specific Objectives

1. **Train future urban actors** capable of responding to the challenges that await space professionals in a digital revolution

2. **Become the place of reflection** on current and future Moroccan cities and on the entire African continent

3. **Promote excellence** in urban systems engineering by structuring the actors in the field

### Strategic Objectives

- **Change the angle of view** of urban studies research in Africa by positioning research in digital, data, and quantitative fields with a societal viewpoint, giving it added value compared to other research on the continent and in the discipline of urban studies

- **Test new methods** and put big data at the center of reflections on resolving complex urban problems, gaining visibility through innovative methods

- **Position the polytechnic vision** as a central element of the center

- **Form future urban actors**, reflect on cities in Morocco and Africa, and promote excellence in urban systems engineering

### Implementation Requirements

To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to first:
- Establish the ecosystem necessary for a center of urban studies
- Train future teachers
- Position itself on the international scene
